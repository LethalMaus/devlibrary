            <strong>Library.google.dev</strong> is a platform for developers to
            find and submit technical content to a library of highly curated
            open source content related to
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/products/" target="blank">
              Google’s products and platforms </a

          <p class="mt-4">
            This platform is designed to be easy to use and will continually
            evolve as more content submissions are made and accepted. Content
            currently accepted onto the site is either Github Repo or a Medium
            blog post. We are working to whitelist submissions from other
            platforms as well. So, stay tuned!

          <p class="mt-6 font-bold">What is the purpose of this site?</p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            For developers to showcase their best examples of using Google
            technologies and for all developers to find inspiration and code
            samples they may want to reuse in their own projects, in the spirit
            of an open source community.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 font-bold">
            Why does Google care about curating this user generated content
            rather than creating documents of their own?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Excellent question! We know there are excellent projects created by
            developers around the world. We have seen creative use cases that we
            had never imagined. This site therefore aims to surface those
            interesting examples so more developers know these as well as get
            inspired to share their own creation.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 font-bold">
            Does this replace Google’s technical documentation and guides?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Not at all! This site is a complement to Google’s official
            documentation. We hope you’ll find inspiring and useful pieces of
            code built by developers worldwide.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 font-bold">
            How does a developer submit content to the site?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            You can submit your content through this
            <a href="https://forms.gle/E54pxK3JzpXMGyqN7" target="blank">form</a
            >. We will take 2-4 weeks to revert back to you on the next steps.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 font-bold">How does a submission get selected?</p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            An editorial committee made up of Googlers and external developer
            experts select the submission if it meets the quality bar.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 font-bold">
            How long does it take for content to be approved and appear on the
            site?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            You should be hearing from us within a couple of weeks of having
            submitted your content. Don’t panic if you don’t hear from us
            though: the volume of submissions may vary over time, but we’ll make
            it a point to always get back to you.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 font-bold">
            Is there any reward or recognition for contributors?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            First of all, if you’re submitting content, we want to say
            <strong
              >“thank you!” on behalf of the entire developer community
            </strong>
            we always appreciate and encourage developers helping each other. If
            your content is selected, we hope that the increased visibility that
            your content gets constitutes an extra token of appreciation.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 font-bold">
            How do you request for content to be removed?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Fill this
            <a href="https://forms.gle/FPQg4s8DUjEdqyQR7" target="blank">
              form </a
            >, and we will get back to you in 48 hours for next steps.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 font-bold">
            How do you report an error in the technical documentation?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Thank you for your help in improving documentation and code. Each
            project or content piece is created by a developer who can possibly
            directly be reached out to on github or medium. The Google project
            team who put this site together does not have the ability to modify
            content. However, if the error pertains to {include different cases:
            abuse, etc.}, please email us at {email e.g. abuse@} with the URL of
            the content page for us to consider delisting it.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-6 font-bold">
            I want to learn how to code, is this the right resource for me?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            If you have never coded yet, this is probably not the best site to
            get started on. Instead type “learn JavaScript” or “learn Python” in
            your favourite search engine :-) and you’ll find many excellent
            resources. If you however have some basic coding knowledge, this
            site may prove useful to you as it references curated open source
            projects and libraries that you can re-use and learn from.
